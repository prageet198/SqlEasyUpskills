Question:-
You are given a dataset from Amazon that tracks and aggregates user activity on their platform in certain time periods. For each device type, 
find the time period with the highest number of active users.

The output should contain 'user_count', 'time_period', and 'device_type', where 'time_period' is a concatenation of 'start_timestamp' and 'end_timestamp', 
like ; "start_timestamp to end_timestamp".

Solution:-
WITH allDevices AS (
SELECT user_count,
device_type,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY device_type ORDER BY user_count DESC) AS rn,
CONCAT(start_timestamp,' to ',end_timestamp) AS time_period
FROM user_activity
)
SELECT user_count,
time_period,
device_type
FROM allDevices
WHERE rn=1
