Question:-
Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email 
addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

Definition:

    action_date refers to the date when users activated their accounts and confirmed their sign-up through text messages.

Solution:-
SELECT emails.user_id
FROM emails INNER JOIN texts ON emails.email_id=texts.email_id
WHERE texts.signup_action='Confirmed' AND
(texts.action_date::date - emails.signup_date::date)=1
ORDER BY emails.email_id
