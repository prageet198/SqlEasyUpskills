Question:-
Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more 
than their direct managers.

As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

Solution:-
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.name
FROM employee AS emp INNER JOIN employee AS mgr
ON emp.manager_id=mgr.employee_id
WHERE emp.salary>mgr.salary
