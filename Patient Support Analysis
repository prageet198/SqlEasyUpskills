Question:-
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for 
their health care needs â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, 
or member portal services.

Write a query to find how many UHG policy holders made three, or more calls, assuming each call is identified by the case_id column.

Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
SELECT policy_holder_id,
COUNT(case_id) AS totalCalls
FROM callers 
GROUP BY policy_holder_id
HAVING COUNT(case_id)>=3
)

SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalPolicyHolders
FROM calculation
