Question:-
Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 
decimal places.

Definition and note:

    Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
    To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

Solution:-
WITH calculation AS (
SELECT app_id,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type='click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS totalClicks,
SUM(CASE WHEN event_type='impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS totalImpression
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp)='2022'
GROUP BY app_id
ORDER BY app_id
)
SELECT app_id,
ROUND((totalClicks* 100.0/totalImpression),2) AS ctr
FROM calculation
