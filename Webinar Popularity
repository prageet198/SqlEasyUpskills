Question:-
As a Data Analyst on Snowflake's Marketing Analytics team, you're analyzing the CRM to determine what percent of marketing touches were of type "webinar"

Did you know? Marketing touches, also known as touch points are the brand's (Snowflake's) point of contact with the customers, from start to finish.

Solution:-
SELECT 
ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN event_type='webinar' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*)))
AS webinarPct
FROM marketing_touches 
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date)='2022' AND 
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date)='4'
