Question:-
As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazonâ€™s airline partners. 
Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. 
For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.

The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."

Solution:-
SELECT flight_id,
entertainment_catalog.movie_id,
entertainment_catalog.duration
FROM flight_schedule INNER JOIN entertainment_catalog ON 1=1
WHERE flight_id='101' AND entertainment_catalog.duration<=flight_duration
