Question:-
Assume that you are given the table below containing information on various orders made by eBay customers. Write a query to obtain the user IDs and number 
of products purchased by the top 3 customers; these customers must have spent at least $1,000 in total.

Output the user id and number of products in descending order. To break ties (i.e., if 2 customers both bought 10 products), the user who spent more 
should take precedence.

Solution:-
SELECT user_id,
COUNT(*) AS totalProductsPurchased
FROM user_transactions 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING SUM(spend)>=1000
ORDER BY totalProductsPurchased DESC, SUM(spend) DESC
LIMIT 3
