Question:-
Microsoft Azure's capacity planning team wants to understand how much data its customers are using, and how much spare capacity is left in each of its 
data centers. You’re given three tables: customers, data centers, and forecasted_demand.

Write a query to find each data centre’s total unused server capacity. Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.

Definitions:

    monthly_capacity is the total monthly server capacity for each centers.
    monthly_demand is the server demand for each customer.
	
Solution:-
WITH demands AS (
SELECT datacenter_id, SUM(monthly_demand) AS totalDemand
FROM forecasted_demand 
GROUP BY datacenter_id
)

SELECT datacenters.datacenter_id,
datacenters.monthly_capacity-demands.totalDemand AS spareCapacity
FROM demands INNER JOIN datacenters 
ON demands.datacenter_id=datacenters.datacenter_id
ORDER BY datacenters.datacenter_id
