Question:-
IBM is analyzing how their employees are utilizing the Db2 database by tracking the SQL queries executed by their employees. The objective is to generate 
data to populate a histogram that shows the number of unique queries run by employees during the third quarter of 2023 (July to September). Additionally, 
it should count the number of employees who did not run any queries during this period.

Display the number of unique queries as histogram categories, along with the count of employees who executed that number of unique queries.


Solution:-
WITH queryCalculation AS (
SELECT employee_id,
COUNT(DISTINCT query_id) AS totalQueries
FROM queries 
WHERE EXTRACT(Quarter FROM query_starttime)='3'
GROUP BY employee_id
ORDER BY employee_id
)

SELECT
CASE WHEN queryCalculation.totalQueries IS NULL THEN 0
ELSE queryCalculation.totalQueries END AS unique_queries,
COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees LEFT JOIN queryCalculation
ON employees.employee_id=queryCalculation.employee_id
GROUP BY queryCalculation.totalQueries
ORDER BY 1
